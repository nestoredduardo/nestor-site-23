        My name is Nestor, I&apos;m a software engineer from Peru. Well, I
        studied industrial engineering, but I&apos;ve had more fun shipping
        products for startups and my own ventures. I&apos;m generalist, but I
        guess my interest converge in make companies win by creating products
        valuable to their users in a sustainable way.

        Beyond business, I think food is amazing, have 4 dogs and use Windows
        haha.
