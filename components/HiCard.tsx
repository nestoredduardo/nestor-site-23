        My name is Nestor, and I&apos;m a software engineer from Peru. I studied
        industrial engineering, but I&apos;ve found more enjoyment in shipping
        products for startups and my own ventures.

        I am a generalist and my interests converge in making companies win by
        creating valuable products for their users in a sustainable way.

        Beyond business, I think food is amazing, have 4 dogs and use Windows
        haha.
